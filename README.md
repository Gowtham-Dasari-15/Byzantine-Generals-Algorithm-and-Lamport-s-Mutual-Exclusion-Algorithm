# Byzantine-Generals-Algorithm-and-Lamport-s-Mutual-Exclusion-Algorithm
Lamportâ€™s Mutual Exclusion ensures orderly access to a shared resource using timestamps for fairness and no central control. The Byzantine Generals algorithm achieves consensus among distributed nodes, even with faulty ones, by message exchange and majority decision, ensuring reliability in distributed and blockchain systems.
